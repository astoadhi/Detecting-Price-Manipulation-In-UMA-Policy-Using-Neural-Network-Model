# Detecting Price Manipulation In UMA Policy Using Neural Network Model

Stock price manipulation is an essential issue for both developed and emerging stock markets. It has been recognized as harmful practices in global share markets. We investigated the characteristics of the stock price manipulation. Two manipulation techniques were studied: pump and dump, spoof trading. Due to the new technology, machine learning algorithms now supporting to detecting stock price manipulation. 

In this research, we use Indonesia Stock Exchange intraday data, and we investigated stocks involved in the Unusual Market Activity (UMA) Announcements during 2008-2017, is there any connection between the UMA and the stock price manipulation. 

We use Neural network model to detect stock price manipulation for each manipulation techniques, after that we want to detect price manipulation, so we took randomly 30 stocks and input it into 2008-2017 model and from the output we got in the first year of  the UMA policy the announcement can detect manipulation but in the next following years the effectiveness is decreasing. From this study, we discover that UMA can be proxies to detect stock price manipulation, but for the long term the announcement can't be a proxy anymore because of technology and science are continuously evolving, the Indonesia Stock Exchange should look for better consideration and evaluation in assessing and publishing UMA announcements
