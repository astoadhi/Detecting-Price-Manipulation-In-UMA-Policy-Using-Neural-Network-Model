# Detecting-Price-Manipulation-In-UMA-Policy-Using-Neural-Network-Model
In this Project, I use Indonesia Stock Exchange intra-day data and we investigated stocks involved in the Unusual Market Activity (UMA) Announcements during 2008-2017, is there any connection between the UMA and the stock price manipulation. We use Neural network model to detect stock price manipulation for each manipulation techniques, after that we compare the output from the model with UMA announcements using confusion matrix. From this study we discover that UMA can be proxies to detect stock price manipulation, but for long term the announcement cant be a proxy anymore because of technology and science are continuously evolving , the Indonesia Stock Exchange should look for better consideration and evaluation in assessing and publishing UMA announcements
